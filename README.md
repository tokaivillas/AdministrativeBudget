# AdministrativeBudget
A spreadsheet to help prepare an administrative budget as required by the Sectional Titles Schemes Management Regulations.

There are probably many ways to "guess" what the operating expenses of a Sectional Title Scheme will be for the next financial year. This spreadsheet is a particular simple one; it simply assumes that the expenses for the current financial year will be the same as for the past year plus some assumed rate of increase/inflation. Given the requirement that Reserve Fund expenses must, as of 2016, be budgeted for separately from Administrative Fund expenses, this is probably not a terrible model.
