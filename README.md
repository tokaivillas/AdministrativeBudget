# AdministrativeBudget
A spreadsheet to help prepare an administrative budget as required by the Sectional Titles Schemes Management Regulations.

There are probably many ways to "guess" what the operating expenses of a Sectional Title Scheme will be for the current financial year. This spreadsheet is a particularly simple one; it assumes that the expenses for the current financial year will be the same as for the past year plus some assumed rate of increase/inflation.
